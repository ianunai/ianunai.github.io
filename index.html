										<h3>Hello, World!</h3>
										<p>
											My name is Anunai Ishan. I am currently a <strong>junior</strong> in <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue University</a>. My <strong>interests</strong> lie in the field of <strong>Software Engineering</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong>. I also have a <strong>minor</strong> in <strong>Management</strong> from the <a href="https://krannert.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Krannert School of Management</a> at <strong>Purdue University</strong>. Outside classroom, I spend time teaching myself new things and using my knowledge to solve problems around me.
										</p>
										<p>
											I volunteered to mentor middle school students at <strong>BoilerCode 2018</strong> (now known as <strong>MiniMake</strong>) in developing their own website and Android application by teaching them the basics of web development and app development in <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/" target="_blank">MIT App Inventor 2</a>. As a secretary of <a href="http://purduelug.org/" target="_blank">Purdue Linux Users Group (PLUG)</a>, I actively manage outreach among students interested in computers and organize tech talks with professors about work most meaningful to them.
										</p>
										<p>
											I an avid reader, and recently finished reading <strong>How to Change the World</strong>: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas by <strong>David Bornstein</strong>. The book imparted an incredible insight into the work of social entrepreneurs all across the globe, ranging from the work of Nobel Prize-winning economist <a href="https://www.ashoka.org/en/story/muhammad-yunus-how-change-world-do-reverse" target="_blank">Muhammad Yunus</a> in pioneering microcredit and microfinance to poor people in Bangladesh to <a href="https://www.ashoka.org/en/fellow/erzs%C3%A9bet-szekeres" target="_blank">Erzsébet Szekeres</a> creating a nationwide program for training, employing and housing disabled adults in Hungary and countless other people. The most important takeaway from this book was how these people came up with creative solutions that had previously never been thought of as they dealt with issues stigmatized by the society.
										</p>
										<p>
											I began teaching myself calligraphy last year and am currently trying to master the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_script" target="_blank">uncial script</a>, used by Latin and Greek scribes from the fourth to eight centuries.
