										<h3>Hello, World!</h3>
										<p style="font-size:1.2em">
											My name is Anunai Ishan. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> from <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue University</a> in December, 2019.
											I also have a minor in Management from the <a href="https://krannert.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Krannert School of Management</a>.
											My interests lie in the fields of Software Engineering and Machine Learning.
											Outside work, I spend time teaching myself new technologies, tools and concepts and using my knowledge to solve problems around me.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size:1.2em">
											I volunteered to mentor middle school students at BoilerCode 2018 (now known as MiniMake) in developing their own website and Android application by teaching them the basics of web development and app development in <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/" target="_blank">MIT App Inventor 2</a>. 
											My interest in mentoring middle school students in familiarizing them with programming and the fact that it encompasses so many fields today led me to join the MiniMake Organizing Committee and work on outreach amongst students in the Lafayette School District 
											and work extensively with other members in designing curriculums for the mentor sessions.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size:1.2em">
											As the former secretary of <a href="http://purduelug.org/" target="_blank">Purdue Linux Users Group (PLUG)</a>, I actively managed outreach among students interested in computing technologies and organized tech talks with professors about their research.
										</p>
										<p style="font-size:1.2em">
											I began teaching myself calligraphy last year and am currently trying to master the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncial_script" target="_blank">uncial script</a>, a majuscule script used by Latin and Greek scribes from the fourth to eight centuries to author religious scriptures.
